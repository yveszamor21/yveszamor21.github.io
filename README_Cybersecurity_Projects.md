# 🔐 Cybersecurity & Networking Projects – DeVry University

Welcome to my cybersecurity project showcase. These labs were completed as part of my Associate Degree in Cybersecurity and Networking at DeVry University. Each project reflects hands-on experience in system hardening, network analysis, ethical hacking, and more.

---

## 🛠️ Network Vulnerability Assessment Lab
Performed internal vulnerability scans using **Nmap** and **Nessus**, identified open ports, high-risk services, and misconfigurations. Delivered a mitigation report with prioritized security improvements.

---

## 🔒 Wireshark Packet Analysis
Captured and analyzed live traffic using **Wireshark**. Filtered TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic to detect anomalies and potential attacks.

---

## 💻 Linux System Hardening Lab
Secured a Linux environment by disabling unnecessary services, enforcing password policies, setting permissions, and configuring **UFW firewall**. Focused on command-line tools and best practices.

---

## 👥 Access Control & Authentication Lab
Implemented **role-based access control (RBAC)** on Windows systems. Created users, assigned permissions, and tested access to enforce least privilege.

---

## 🧠 Risk Management Project
Conducted a full risk assessment simulation. Identified assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and calculated risk levels using **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** methodology.

---

## 🌐 Cloud Security Fundamentals Lab
Built a basic cloud environment on **AWS**, created IAM roles, applied security groups, and tested access controls. Practiced applying security best practices in cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🧪 Incident Response Simulation
Completed an end-to-end cyber incident response drill. Documented detection, containment, eradication, recovery steps, and drafted an incident report for internal use.

---

## 💼 More Projects Coming Soon
Continuing to expand my portfolio with ethical hacking tools, scripting (Bash & Python), malware analysis, and endpoint security labs.
